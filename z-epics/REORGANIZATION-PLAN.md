## Changes Being Made

### 1. Add Detailed Phases for Sprint 3.8-3.13
Each sprint will have:
- **Purpose & Business Value**
- **Backend Tasks** (Database schema, Services, Controllers, Routes)
- **Frontend Tasks** (Pages, Components, Forms, Integration)
- **User Stories**
- **Acceptance Criteria**
- **Benefits & ROI**

### 2. Create Comprehensive Task Checklist
Format:
```markdown
- [ ] **Task Name** - Purpose: Why this task is critical for textile manufacturing
  - Subtask 1
  - Subtask 2
```

### 3. Reorganize by Priority
Priority Order:
1. Project Overview & Architecture (Foundation)
2. Completed Work (What's Done)
3. In-Progress Work (Current Focus)
4. Planned Core Features (Next Up)
5. Recommended Advanced Features (Future)
6. Standards & Guidelines (How We Build)
7. Project Management (Tracking & Metrics)
8. Appendix (Reference Material)

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Backup current file
2. 🔄 Reorganize existing content
3. 🔄 Add detailed Sprint 3.8-3.13 phases
4. 🔄 Create comprehensive task checklist
5. 🔄 Add purpose statements for all tasks
6. 🔄 Validate structure and alignment
7. 🔄 Commit changes

## File Size Management
- Current: ~1765 lines
- After reorganization: ~2500-3000 lines (with detailed Sprint 3.8-3.13)
- Solution: Keep in single file for now, consider splitting if >3500 lines
